# Plants-Vs.-Zombies
This project involved students to create a side-scrolling game where objects from the left or right move to the opposite side. Plants Vs. Zombies was coded using Java. This game involved the creation of a start, help, game, and end screens. The goal of the game is to defend the base from zombies coming from the right. Using the keyboard, players strategically place objects to help defend the base.  See project Plants Vs. Zombies Mock Game
